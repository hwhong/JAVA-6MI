What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was really cool. The idea of encrypting and decrypting has always intrigued me. In this assignment, I learned
how the operation of encrypting and decrypting works. There is a certain "key(number of steps)" which the letter would be 
moving, and according to the user inputs, the letters will move forward or backward accordingly. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- Though the actual programming wasn't hard, it was the idea of counting how much the letters should be moved and also the 
letters would wrap around if the key exceeds a certain value. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- pretty cool assignment!
