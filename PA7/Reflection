What I've learned from doing the project? 
- Though this project was quite easy to implement, the concept learned was really neat. 
In this assingment, I learned the idea of having abstract methods and have other files extend from it, in order to force 
the programmer to implement the abstract methods that are in the abstract class. 

Though the folder only included one java file, there are 7 more files that are more or less the same when it comes to 
implmentation. The idea or concept is what matters!

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- This PA was relatively easier, nevertheless, I had some problems with implementing the line file.

Note to future Warren (lol)
- nothing much here, do more projects!
