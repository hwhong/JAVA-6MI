What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was probably the hardest out of all the assignments I've done in the span of 6 months. In this project, I had 
to implement the game 2048 along with its front-end. The implementation of the back-end took 2 weeks, while the implementation
of the frontend took 1 week to complete. In the duration of this project, I've learned SO MUCH! 

1. How some web applications started by creating the concept, then uses Gui to make it look more user friendly, while under
the hood, everything is just code. (before programming this assignment I had trouble understanding the link from codes to 
actually making a product that we uses on a daily basis)
2. I learned more about user inputs and his/her interaction with the program.
3. the many operations that goes in creating a web application.
4. How to mimic what you are trying to create by first printing it onto the concole
5. The power of Gui and how it makes every looks so much prettier. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- I think the most trouble I had was with updating the grid and how one key operation (up, down, left, right) would change the
whole scheme of the grid. I also a little bug with moving the grid in the right direction after implementing the Gui, turns 
out I've implemented up for left, and down for right, and vice versa. Also had some trouble with updating the score after one
iteration of play. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- CS IS SO MUCH FUN!
