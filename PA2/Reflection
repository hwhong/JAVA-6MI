What I've learned from doing the project? 
- I learned about the idea of scanner and printwriter and how they would be used in programming. I think through by doing 
more of these assignment, not only was I able to learn more concepts with regards to java, but also able to understand more 
helpful functions (e.g hasNext). I also learned that to compare object, a simple "==" is incorrect, but should rather compare
using the equals function.

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- I think the most trouble I had was with the printing function. I was quite unfamiliar with the printwriter, and how it
works. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- you should familiarize youself with researching functions, and use the java documentation to help you program. :)
