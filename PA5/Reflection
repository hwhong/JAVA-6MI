What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project helped me be more familiar with the concept of inheritance and the power of it. Though this folder only contains
one file called Lion, there were two other animals that both extends from one "animal" file. The idea of inheritance is really
interesting. I learned how I should group the files when it comes to inheritance. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- abiding to the assingment writeup

Note to future Warren (lol)
- utilize the idea of inheritance when implementing other liked functioning files
