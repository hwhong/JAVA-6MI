# JAVA-6MI
Documentation of my journey to become a better java programmer! his repository documents some of the projects I have done in school along with my reflection of these projects. This repository only includes the projects I've done in my first 6 months with coding (hence 6MI[6 Months In]!), so that I could better document my progression. (sequel to JAVA 3MI repository haha)

Similar to JAVA 3MI, Reflections include:

- What I've learned from doing the project
- What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment
- Note to future Warren (lol)
