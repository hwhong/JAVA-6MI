What I've learned from doing the project? 
- This project was focused on the idea of recursion. I learned that by calling a recursive function, pictorolly , there are 
breanches that follow each function call, and each function call leads to additional branches in the graph. 

What were the obstacles that I've encountered while coding for this assignment? 
- Recursion can be a really beautiful way of solving a problem, but it was quite hard to implement, understanding when to call
the recursing function, and what happens when the function is called. 

Note to future Warren (lol)
- try and do more projects with implementing recursion. I think recursion helps with drawing memory diagram. (y)
